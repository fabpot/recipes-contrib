One thing I don't know how to translate is the 2 lines that we needed to add to the old `app/autoload.php` (see the [docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineMongoDBBundle/index.html#register-the-annotations-and-the-bundle) for the lines in question). Any idea ?

The ORM annotation driver was lazy-loaded in symfony/symfony#21837, maybe something similar could be done for the ODM, I don't know ðŸ˜•

Actually, as the ODM bundle uses the annotation_reader defined by Symfony, it automatically benefits from the change done in Symfony (as long as the ODM annotations are autoloadable, but I think they are).

Yeah. I tested it in a fresh application and it works as expected.

Should be good now.
