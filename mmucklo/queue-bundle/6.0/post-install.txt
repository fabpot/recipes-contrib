Please update config/packages/dtc_queue.yaml:

# config/packages/dtc_queue.yaml
dtc_queue:
    manager:
        # This parameter is required and should typically be set to one of:
        #   [odm|orm|beanstalkd|rabbit_mq|redis]
        job: orm
    # ...

For a full list of configuration options, see:
   * https://github.com/mmucklo/DtcQueueBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/full-configuration.md

If you use the "orm" job manager, you'll want to create a migration or update the schema on your database manually. For more info see:
   * https://github.com/mmucklo/DtcQueueBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/symfony4-5.md

For admin, make sure twig-pack or twig-bundle + twig is installed.

On older versions of Symfony, the following might be necessary:

# config/packages/framework.yaml
framework:
    # ...
    templating:
        engines: ['twig']
