    1. Print the sql statements required to update your database schema by running <info>php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql</>.
    2. If the statements look fine to you, run the same command using <info>--force</> to execute them.
    3. Make sure your user has all the necessary permissions for the <fg=green>SuluFormBundle</>.
